TODO:
- fix header issues
- fix issue where entering an incorrect sun mass will still let you enter the simulation
- make a reusable function for drawing planets
- allow user to change “sun” by adding another planet with more mass
- add eccentricity and accurate timing in different areas of orbit 
- submit simulation to site permanently so others can see it
- allow user to change colors of planets
- add gradient to background 
- make planets different sizes
- alert user if they make planets that will bump into each other
- replace ‘magic numbers‘ with variables
